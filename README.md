# SENLATasks
Packages with tasks are placed in SENLATest/src.
There is class Runner in each task, which launches programms and interacts with User. But not in the last one (Rucksack). There I just form arrays of costs and weights statically in Runner.

In programm SimplicityChecker I placed probabilistic method for checking number, which works faster than simple method and the probability of mistake is small. Methos is called "Test of Solovey-Strassen". Nevertheless, there is also simple accurate method.
